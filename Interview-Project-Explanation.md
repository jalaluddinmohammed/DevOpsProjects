# DevOps Project Explanation

## Introduction
This guide explains how to effectively describe a DevOps project in an interview, providing insights into the project flow and architecture.

## 1. Project Initiation
- Start with a client or manager raising a Jira ticket for a new feature request.
- Example: Change the background color of the application.

## 2. Development Stage
- Assign the Jira ticket to a developer.
- Developer writes and tests the source code locally.
- Once validated, the code is pushed to a GitHub repository.

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline Setup (DevOps Stage)
- A DevOps engineer sets up a CI/CD pipeline triggered by GitHub commits.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline Stages
   - a. **Compile and Test**
      - Maven is used to compile the source code and run unit tests.
   - b. **SonarQube Code Quality Check**
      - SonarQube checks for code quality, bugs, and code coverage.
   - c. **Maven Build Package**
      - Package the application for easy distribution.
   - d. **OS Dependency Check**
      - Scan for vulnerabilities in OS dependencies.
   - e. **Artifact Repository (Nexus)**
      - Deploy the application artifact to Nexus for version management.

## 5. Docker Image Creation and Scanning
- Create a Docker image using a Dockerfile.
- Scan the Docker image for vulnerabilities using Trivy.
- Push the Docker image to Docker Hub repository.

## 6. Kubernetes Deployment
- Write YAML Manifest files for Kubernetes deployment.
- Deploy the application to Kubernetes.

## 7. Continuous Monitoring
- Utilize monitoring tools like Grafana and Prometheus for 24/7 application monitoring.

## 8. Penetration Testing
- Conduct penetration testing using tools like OWASP ZAP to identify vulnerabilities.
- Inform developers to fix any identified vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
This comprehensive DevOps project flow ensures security, continuous integration, and efficient deployment. This structured explanation can effectively showcase your project during a DevOps interview.
